description: "This past week I gave a short presentation at the monthly TulsaWebDevs meeting about setting up a secure website using Let&#39;s Encrypt. I covered a brief (minimal) overview of how SSL/TLS works and a comparison in the processes of the traditional way to acquire an SSL certificate and acquiring a certificate via the ACME protocol. The slides are now up if you&#39;d like to check them out over on my Presentations page. If you&#39;d like to view my speakers notes simply press `s` while viewing the slideshow in Chrome.
