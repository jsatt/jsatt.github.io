<p>I&#39;ve often found Python&#39;s context managers to be pretty useful. They make a nice interface that can handle starting and ending of temporary things for you, like opening and closing a file.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">f = open(&#39;myfile.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;)
try:
    for row in records:
        f.write(row)
finally:
     f.close()</code></pre>

<p>can be replaced with</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">with open(&#39;myfile.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
    for row in records:
        f.write(row)</code></pre>

<p>This last week I was working with the ZipFile module and wanted to use it&#39;s context manger interface, but I ran into a little confusion when it came to unit testing. After a little better understanding of how context managers work, I figured out that the <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> methods are what really makes a context handler. As <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/contextlib/">explained at PyMOTW</a>, when you invoke <code>with</code> on a class, __enter__ is called and should return an object to be used in the context (<code>f</code> in the above example), the code within the block is executed, and <code>__exit__</code> is called no matter the outcome of the block. So both of these would be roughly equivalent, assuming <code>do_stuff</code> doesn&#39;t raise an exception.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">with Context(foo) as bar:
    do_stuff(bar)

c = Context(foo)
bar = c.__enter__()
try:
    do_stuff(bar)
finally:
    c.__exit__(None, None, None)</code></pre>

<p>With this understanding, here is the solution to my mocking problem using PyMox.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">#module/tasks.py
def zip_it_up(filename):
    with ZipFile(filename, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
        for file in FILES:
            f.write(file.path, file.name)

# tests.py
... # setup and stuff is up here somewhere
def test_building_zipfile(self):
    self.mock.StubOutWithMock(module.tasks, &#39;ZipFile&#39;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mock_zip = self.mock.CreateMockAnything()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; module.tasks.ZipFile(&#39;/tmp/export.zip&#39;, &#39;w&#39;).AndReturn(mock_zip)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mock_zip.__enter__().AndReturn(mock_zip)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mock_zip.write(&#39;/tmp/export-1.xml&#39;, &#39;export-1.xml&#39;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mock_zip.write(&#39;/tmp/export-2.xml&#39;, &#39;export-2.xml&#39;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mock_zip.__exit__(None, None, None)

    self.mock.ReplayAll()
    zip_it_up()
    self.mock.VerifyAll()</code></pre>

<p>Mocking out ZipFile allows us to return a mock object from it&#39;s instantiation. We can then set the expectation that __enter__ will be called on the instance, returning the instance itself, expecting <code>write</code> to be called twice on the instance and finally __exit__ to be called. The three arguments of <code>None</code> here are to indicate that an exception isn&#39;t expected. If the code inside the context block were to raise an exception, these arguments would be the <code>type</code>, <code>value</code> and <code>traceback</code> as returned by <code>raise</code>. In the event you are testing for an exception, these arguments should be set accordingly when setting expectations.</p>
