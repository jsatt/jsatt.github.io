One of the other developers brought up they&#39;re struggles recently with having to conduct a technical interview for the first time. They&#39;re a very qualified developer and has been on the interviewee end of technical interviews by some of the more high profile companies in the tech industry. But just knowing what kinds of things happen during a technical interview doesn&#39;t necessarily prepare you to interview another developer well."

<p>A few months ago I was having a beer with several other developer friends after our local user group meeting, discussing our latest projects, problems and hobbies. One of the other developers brought up they&#39;re struggles recently with having to conduct a technical interview for the first time. They&#39;re a very qualified developer and has been on the interviewee end of technical interviews by some of the more high profile companies in the tech industry. But just knowing what kinds of things happen during a technical interview doesn&#39;t necessarily prepare you to interview another developer well.</p>

<p>This conversation caused me to think back at the last couple years of my own career which has taken me from never interviewing anyone, or even feeling I was qualified to conduct an interview, to being part of interviewing about 15 other developers and helping to grow my current team from two developers to 7 in about 6 months. So for my fellow developers who are still at the beginning of that journey I wanted to share the experiences of myself and my current and previous teams.</p>

<h2>Be Kind</h2>

<p>Remember that no matter how qualified an interviewee may be, the receiving end of the interview process is a very stressful experience. Do your best to make it a relaxed environment. Reassure them no single mistake will ruin their chances.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that interviewing should be a two-way process. Even if you want to higher them, they may not feel it&#39;s a fit for their goals. Encourage them to ask questions. Be straight forward and honest with your answers.</p>

<h2>Empower the Team</h2>

<p>While HR and management are generally key parts of the process, the team that the new member would be working with on a daily basis should be the biggest piece of the puzzle which interviewing someone. The team are the experts in the problems needing to be solved, what knowledge and abilities it takes to solve them and what type of person will work best within the teams processes to be most effective. This should be front and center in the interview process. They should have the chance to ask the interviewee the about their past, their plans for the future and their hobbies. They should be the people giving any technical exercises. And they should be the most important vote when deciding whether to make the hire or not. They should understand up front that they have this freedom, but also that this responsibility has the power to affect the project, the team, the organization they work for and, of course, the life and goals of the person they are interviewing.</p>

<h2>Finding a Compatible Personality</h2>

<p>In my experience, finding team members that fit into social circle of existing team is the most important and sometimes hardest part of the hiring process. You want someone who can communicate effectively with the other members and asks for help or admits they don&#39;t know rather than making something up. &quot;Rock stars&quot; and &quot;Ninjas&quot; need not apply.</p>

<p>For my current team we&#39;ve found that to best way to judge this is to have a team lunch. Whether going out to a nearby restaurant, having something delivered or just having everyone take an extended coffee break together, this should be just as informal and laid back of a lunch as you might have in the office on any other day. This time should also be open to everyone on the team as well as project managers, product owners or other people in the organization that are part of the day-to-day working of the team. This is the ideal time to find out about their background, where they grew up, what they do for fun, what kind of music influences would they bring to the team playlist, but don&#39;t make the interviewee feel like they&#39;re facing a firing line of hard questions. Let them see how the team interacts together in regular social situations, share details about yourselves and let them ask questions about the team.</p>

<h2>Technical Questions</h2>

<p>This should be the time when the interviewee is taken aside and asked the questions where you really understand they&#39;re qualifications. Attendees of this portion should be down to 2 or 3 team members. Any more than this can be overwhelming for the interviewee. Due to the limited attendees, if the interviewee is a referral from someone on the team, the person doing the referring should generally recuse themselves or at least participate very little in this portion allowing as many members as possible that just met the interviewee the best opportunity to get to know them for themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good idea for the team to sit down together before the interview and compile a list of questions that they feel are important to building the team. This may include questions about how they&#39;d solve conflicting ideas with a team member, what they enjoyed about a previous project or something absurd like what kind of tree they&#39;d be and why. It&#39;s really up to the team. This shouldn&#39;t be considered a script but a list of suggestions when the interviewers are trying to think about what else they should ask.</p>

<p>Overall use this time to find out anything that you think you need to know about the interviewee to find out if they are a fit for the position.</p>

<h2>Excerscises</h2>

<p>When interviewing for a developer position I highly recommend doing technical excercises. By doing a live coding session when doing technical excercises you get to see how the developer works through problems, how much they know off the top of their head and how well they can find an answer on the web when they get stuck. They should absolutely be able to use any resource they have on any other day to solve it. This includes Google, so long as they don&#39;t go searching for &quot;Solution to X excercise&quot;.</p>

<p>Tools like LogMeIn or shared sessions on Koding can be very useful when interviewing remotely and Koding has the added benefit of you now have a copy of their code to share with team members who aren&#39;t present.</p>

<p>Pick problems that actually have pertinence to the day-to-day work of the position. Asking a front-end developer whose going to be building input forms in React to solve a Binary Tree Search probably doesn&#39;t help anyone to know if they are a good fit. I&#39;m a fan of something like a FizzBuzz, that is a simple logic puzzle, solvable in a short time and has a couple minor gotchas that most people don&#39;t immediately consider and can show how well they can debug. However this has become a very common excercise and is an easy one to memorize, so we&#39;ve taken the traditional FizzBuzz and modified it just slightly to still tell us what we find relevant about the problem, but putting people who memorized their solutions on a more level ground with the first timers. The exercises you chose is up to you and should be as unique as the project you work on, not just a random problem found on the internet.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t place the success or failure of the entire interview on the techincal exercises. Remember that the point of the exercise is to see the process they follow to solve problems, how quickly can they use other resources to learn a different way to solve the problem and how willing are they to show they need help rather than bluff their way through it. A junior developer who struggles with solving the problem but is a personality fit and shows they are willing to learn may be more desirable for the team then a lone wolf who solves it in five minutes.</p>
