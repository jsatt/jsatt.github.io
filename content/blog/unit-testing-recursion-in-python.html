The problem has always been that I&#39;d like to test that a function recurses, but not needing it to actually have the recursion execute within to test. Just a unit test to assert that recursion is happening. After a little thought about how Python stores references I came up with this."

<p>Today I finally figured out the solution to a problem I&#39;ve been trying to solve for a while. It&#39;s kind of hacky and maybe a bad idea, but now I know it&#39;s possible. The problem has always been that I&#39;d like to test that a function recurses, but not needing it to actually have the recursion execute within to test. Just a unit test to assert that recursion is happening. After a little thought about how Python stores references I came up with this.</p>

<pre class="language-python">
<code>class ExampleTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.task = Task()
    # ...
    # other test stuff
    # ...

    def test_recursion(self):
        original_func = self.task.run
        self.mock.StubOutWithMock(Task, &#39;run&#39;)

        Task.run(id=44)

        self.mock.ReplayAll()
        original_func(id=22)
        self.mock.VerifyAll()
</code></pre>

<p>Because variables in Python are just references to objects in memory, if you create a new reference before stubbing out the primary reference, pointing it to a mock object, you can still access it via this new reference. You&#39;re now free to check that recusion is happening, without the need for it to actually recurse in the test.</p>
