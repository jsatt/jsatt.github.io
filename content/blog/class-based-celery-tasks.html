<p>Update 2017-11-02: Celery 4 now <a href="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-4.0.html#the-task-base-class-no-longer-automatically-register-tasks">adivises against inheriting from Task</a> unless you are extending common functionality. However you can still get similar functionality by creating a new class and calling is from inside a decorated function task.</p>

<pre>
<code>class MyTask(object):
    def run(self, source):
        do_stuff()
    ...

@app.task
def my_task(source):
    MyTask().run(source)
</code></pre>

<p>Original Post:</p>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve had to write several complicated Celery tasks. Unfortunately, when doing a complicated process standard task functions can become unwieldy to write, read and unit test. After looking into how Celery tasks actually work, I was able to find a more manageable way of writing these complex tasks.</p>

<p>It turns out the <code>task</code> decorator that you&#39;re used to using is just an object factory for <code>Task</code> objects that turns the decorated function into the <code>run</code> method of on the <code>Task</code> instance it creates. Skipping the decorator and extending the <code>Task</code> class directly makes things a little more flexible.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">from celery import Task


class MyTask(Task):
    ignore_result = True

    def run(self, source, *args, **kwargs):
        self.source = source
        data = self.collect_data()
        self.generate_file(data)

    def generate_file(self, data):
        # do your file generation here
        ...
    
    def collect_data(self):
        # do your data collection here
        ...
        return data</code>
</pre>

<p>In this case <code>run</code> is the equivalent of the function task you&#39;re used to, but thanks to OOP you&#39;re free to break some of the more complex code into logic blocks, <code>collect_data</code> and <code>generate_file</code>, and access to instance attribute, <code>source</code>.</p>

<p>To call the task your just need to instantiate the it and call the desired method to trigger it.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">task = MyTask()

# Run on Celery worker now
task.delay(123)

# Run on Celery worker at a sepcfic time 
task.apply_async(args=[123], eta=datetime(2015, 6, 5, 12, 30, 22))

# Run task directly, No celery worker
task.run(123)
task(123)
</code></pre>

<p>Testing also now becomes easier as well since you can test each unit on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>For most cases, your standard function-based classes are probably going to do the job. But for those extra complex cases, class-based might make things easier work with.</p>
